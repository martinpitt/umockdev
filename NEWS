0.6 (2014-02-15)
----------------
- Also send DEVNAME in uevent when available. Thanks Chris Halse Rogers!
- Send an "add" uevent when adding a device
- umockdev-record --ioctl now stores the name of the device node recorded
  in the trace. umockdev_testbed_load_ioctl(testbed, NULL, "device.ioctl")
  now automatically associates the ioctl trace with the original device
  node. (issue #33)

0.5.1 (2014-01-16)
------------------
- Update devices/cameras/canon-powershot-sx200.ioctl with ioctls from
  libgphoto2 2.5.3, to make the /umockdev-run/integration/gphoto-* tests work
  with that version.

0.5 (2014-01-08)
----------------
- Add generic support for variable length structs without pointers to
  substructs. Definitions of such ioctls must provide a get_data_size()
  function which returns the number of bytes based on the ioctl number and the
  data pointer.
- Declare libc ioctl type correctly using varargs. On some architectures (e.g.
  ppc64el) the calling convention for varargs is sufficiently different that
  the previous declaration caused stack corruption. Thanks Colin Watson!

0.4.7 (2013-11-14)
------------------
- Skip umockdev-record loop device test if /sys exists, but there is no loop
  device.
- Slightly relax timings in /umockdev-testbed/script_replay_simple test to
  avoid failure on slow machines.
- preload: Wrap chmod() and inotify_add_watch().
- Fix assertion on umockdev_testbed_uevent() if there are no listeners.
  (issue #29)

0.4.6 (2013-10-11)
------------------
- Fix wrong select() call timeout which caused a failure on arm64.
- Skip umockdev-record tests which need /sys if there is no real /sys.
  (Debian #724203)

0.4.5 (2013-09-17)
------------------
- Make various test cases more robust.

0.4.4 (2013-09-16)
------------------
- testsuite: Write "skip" messages to stdout instead of stderr.
- README.rst: Add information about building, testing, running, and
  contributing.
- Add code coverage reporting with gcov and lcov, using the gnome-common
  macros. autogen.sh will enable this automatically if lcov is installed.
- Support comments in scripts and ioctl records, lines starting with '#' get
  ignored.

0.4.3 (2013-08-23)
------------------
- preload: Don't call overridden readlink() in helper function. Fixes building
  with gcc 4.6 and older. (issue #27)
- Support USBDEVFS_GET_CAPABILITIES ioctl.
- preload: Repair recording if device gets opened multiple times (got broken in
  0.3)
- ioctl recording: Never consider input URBs equal even if they have exactly
  the same data, as that might give a mismatch between identical SUBMITs and
  different REAPs.

0.4.2 (2013-08-01)
------------------
- preload: Don't intercept netlink socket() calls during recording.
- Update devices/cameras/canon-powershot-sx200.ioctl for libgphoto 2.5.

0.4.1 (2013-07-29)
------------------
Bug fixes:
- preload: Wrap __open_2() and __open64_2().

0.4 (2013-07-29)
----------------
New features:
- Add recording of Unix stream sockets. (part of issue #24)
- Add new method umockdev_testbed_load_socket_script() to replay recorded
  read()s/recv()s and write()s/send()s to a Unix socket. (part of issue #24)
- Add new umockdev-run option -u/--unix-stream to load a script for a mocked
  Unix socket into the testbed. (part of issue #24)
- Add new script file operation "f" to set a fuzz level when comparing expected
  incoming strings. (issue #26)
- Add docs/script-format.txt: document the umockdev script format.
- README.rst: Add unix socket record/replay example.

Bug fixes:
- Quote send/received data in script replay debug output, to get along with
  embedded null bytes and control characters. (issue #25)

0.3.2 (2013-07-18)
------------------
- script replay: Fix endless loop on end of script file.
- Fix /umockdev-run/integration/input-evtest for 32 bit architectures. Add a
  script recorded on 32 bit and select the right one in the test.
- Fix race condition in /umockdev-record/script-log-simple test which sometimes
  caused this to fail on slow machines.

0.3.1 (2013-07-18)
------------------
- Fix /umockdev-run/integration/input-touchpad test case to not leave behind an
  Xorg process on failure.
- Skip /umockdev-run/integration/input-touchpad test case on big-endian
  machines, as we do not have ioctl data from big endian machines at the moment.
- Flush the output file after each script recording event, to avoid losing data
  when recording programs that get terminated with a signal.
- Intercept SIGINT during ioctl recording, so that the record gets written even
  if the recorded program gets terminated with Control-C.
- Fix /umockdev-testbed-usb/lsusb test case to work with libusbx 1.0.16.
- Create PTY devices (for usage with get_dev_fd()) instead of plain files for
  other device types than tty as well, except for SUBSYSTEM=="usb". With that
  you can use record&replay for e. g. input or DRI control devices.
  (main part of issue #5)
- Reading scripts during device playback does not wrap around at EOF any more.
  This more closely reproduces how real devices behave. If we actually get an
  use case for wrapping around, we can do this by adding a new operation type
  to script files.

0.3 (2013-07-12)
----------------
Command line argument changes (not backwards compatible):
- Change umockdev-record's --ioctl option: The argument is now
  "devicefile=outputfile" like with umockdev-run, instead of specifying the
  device as the first positional argument. This was inconsistant, and is
  necessary to support other kinds of recording in the future.
- Rename umockdev-run's -l/--load option to -d/--device. Other kinds of files
  (ioctl dumps, and read/write scripts) also get "loaded" into the testbed, so
  the previous name does not make sense any more.

New features/API:
- Emulate SUBSYSTEM=tty mocked device nodes as PTYs instead of plain files, so
  that they behave tty-like and respond to the relevant ioctls.
  (first part of issue #9)
- Add new method umockdev_testbed_get_dev_fd() to get the master end file
  descriptor for simulated tty devices (and possibly other kinds of devices in
  the future), so that a test suite can communicate with clients that connect
  to the simulated tty device node. (second part of issue #9)
- Add recording of read()s and write()s to a device into files, called
  "device scripts". Add umockdev-record option -s/--script for this.
- Add new method umockdev_testbed_load_script() to replay read()s and
  write()s of a device from a script. (issue #18)
- Add new option -s/--script to umockdev-run to load a script into the testbed.
  (issue #18)
- Add new method umockdev_testbed_set_attribute_link() to set attributes which
  are symlinks; most importantly this allows testbeds to set the "driver"
  attribute. (first part of issue #22)
- Record the "driver" attribute in umockdev-record, and restore it in
  umockdev_testbed_add_from_string(). (second part of issue #22)
- Add new method umockdev_testbed_remove_device() to remove a sysfs device and
  all its associated links, device node, etc. (issue #17)

Bug fixes:
- umockdev-run: Give proper error message if --ioctl argument is invalid.
- preload: Only look up original libc functions once. (issue #21)
- preload: Wrap fclose(). (issue #20)
- Work around gtk-doc non-POSIX recursive variable expansion with automake >=
  1.13 and gtk-doc >= 1.19, which previously failed autogen.sh.
- Do not export internal symbols in libumockdev library.

0.2.11 (2013-07-03)
-------------------
- Do not overwrite an existing $LD_PRELOAD in umockdev-run and umockdev-record.
- Add "make check-valgrind" target to debug memory leaks.
- Add recently added API to reference documentation.
- Fix various memory leaks.

0.2.10 (2013-07-01)
-------------------
- Make stat()ing of emulated /dev/ nodes appear as actual block/char device
  nodes with proper major/minor number, instead of regular files. (issue #16)
- Add umockdev_testbed_add_from_file() convenience wrapper around
  add_from_string(). (issue #15)
- Handle USBDEVFS_REAPURB ioctls without a previous SUBMITURB like the real USB
  stack (return EAGAIN instead of crashing with an assertion). This makes
  umockdev work with gvfs' mtp backend.

0.2.9 (2013-06-20)
------------------
- preload: Do not change errno when calculating wrapped paths.
- Add umockdev_testbed_disable() and umockdev_testbed_enable() methods for
  temporarily disabling the emulated /sys and /dev. This can be used for
  temporarily switching back to the real /sys and /dev without having to
  destroy or change $UMOCKDEV_DIR and the UMockdevTestbed instance (which is
  difficult when these get exported to subprocesses like local D-BUS
  instances).

0.2.8 (2013-06-17)
------------------
- Link the typelib to the SONAMEd library, not the version-less development
  symlink.

0.2.7 (2013-06-17)
------------------
- Slightly relax errno test in /umockdev-testbed-vala/usbfs_ioctl_static, the
  real call might fail not just with ENOTTY but also with EINVAL.
- Fix tests to work on big-endian machines (tested on powerpc32).

0.2.6 (2013-06-13)
------------------
- Do not use automake 1.13's parallel test runner. It not buy much for this
  project, and makes it a lot harder to analyse test failures from build logs.
- Add umockdev_testbed_clear() method to remove all added devices (both sysfs
  and /dev). This is useful for cleaning up between tests in situations where
  the UMockdevTestbed object itself needs to be kept.
- test-umockdev-run: Write X.org log into a file, point to it on X.org startup
  failure, and also point out that this needs X.org's dummy driver installed.
  (issue #12)
- Fix ioctl file reading on platforms which have unsigned "char" by default,
  such as ARM. (issue #11)
- Do not read sysfs attributes of any Tegra device (on ARM systems), as these
  often trigger kernel crashes (see https://launchpad.net/bugs/1190225).
  (issue #11)
- Allow uncommon characters in sysfs attribute names.
- devices/input/synaptics-touchpad.ioctl: Add ioctl for 32 bit systems.
  (issue #13)

0.2.5 (2013-06-10)
------------------
- Fix test-umockdev lsusb check to work in environments without any
  /dev/bus/usb.
- preload: Do not destroy errno on wrapping open() under umockdev-record.
- Add --version option to umockdev-run and umockdev-record.
- Fix building with Vala 0.20.

0.2.4 (2013-06-05)
------------------
- Fix "make check" for current automake 1.13.
- Add "make check-installed" target to run tests against the installed umockdev
  instead of against the build tree.

0.2.3 (2013-05-25)
------------------
- preload: Wrap fopen64() call; fixes operation on 32 bit architectures.
  (issue #10)

0.2.2 (2013-05-24)
------------------
- umockdev-run: Fix segfault if no program is specified. (issue #6)
- preload: Print proper error message instead of assertion when trying to load
  an empty or invalid ioctl record. (issue #8)
- umockdev-run: Fix --help output to not mention the child program twice.
- Fix DEVNAME property with older libudev versions.
- Handle "L:" (link priority) lines from udevadm for newer udev versions.
- Fix segfault with gcc 4.8 (due to changed behaviour of sizeof).
- Drop our posix_extra backport of execvp(), this was added to Vala 0.16.1.
  Bump vala dependency accordingly.

0.2.1 (2013-02-21)
------------------
- umockdev-wrapper: Use exec to avoid keeping the shell process around and make
  killing the subprogram from outside work properly.
- Fix building with automake 1.12, thanks Peter Hutterer.
- Support opening several netlink sockets (i. e. udev monitors) at the same
  time.
- Fix building with older kernels which don't have the EVIOCGMTSLOTS ioctl yet.

0.2 (2013-02-20)
----------------
Compatibility break: This does not work any more with recorded ioctl files from
version 0.1.

- umockdev-run: Fix running of child program to keep stdin.
- preload: Fix resolution of "/dev" and "/sys"
- ioctl_tree: Fix endless loop when the first encountered ioctl was unknown
- preload: Support opening a /dev node multiple times for ioctl emulation
  (issue #3)
- Fix parallel build (issue #2)
- Support xz compressed ioctl files in umockdev_testbed_load_ioctl().
- Add example umockdev and ioctl files for a gphoto camera and an MTP capable
  mobile phone.
- Fix building with automake 1.11.3 and Vala 0.16.
- Generalize ioctl recording and emulation for ioctls with simple structs, i.
  e. no pointer fields. This makes it much easier to add more ioctls in the
  future. 
- Store return values of ioctls in records, as they are not always 0
  (like EVIOCGBIT)
- Add support for ioctl ranges (like EVIOCGABS) and ioctls with variable length
  (like EVIOCGBIT).
- Add all reading evdev ioctls, for recording and mocking input devices like
  touch pads, touch screens, or keyboards. (issue #1)

0.1 (2013-02-12)
----------------
Initial release.
